# MedAll (All Medical)

## About the website

Hello, My name is Ali Najafzadeh and this is my final project for [Harvard CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) course. I want to implement a website named *“MedAll”* that was created in order to give “Medical Students” a chance to have a smart platform for studying. This platform has content section, questions, flashcards, etc.

There are different sections on the website. You can read different topics, answer to their related questions, flashcards, etc.
The main feature of this website is the review section that is a mixture of “precision-recall curve”, “Leitner”and “Memo Based Review”. this section provides a complete automated design for get the best out of studying.

The content section has +25 writers to help students good categorized lessons to study. In database these sections are divided into 4 names: Category, Ward, Lesson, Block. This waterfall division method helps students have more organized information. Text content is not the only content in this platform there are pictures, videos, questions and some case studies related to the topic.


## Description

The Front-end of this website uses React.js, Redux, Semantic UI, React Router, etc. The Back-end in other hand uses PHP (Laravel Framework). These two parts communicate to each other via REST Api.
This WebApp gives a full responsive view for all devices and a great native experience for mobile users provided by a service worker that would help the app cache some parts of the website.
I am working on the front-end of this website with javascript, html, css, sass, react.js, etc.

## How to use
The address of this website is [MedAll](https://MedAll.app/). Everyone can have a trial account to experience and work with the features of this website.
